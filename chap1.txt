When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My
fingers stretch out, seeking Prim’s warmth but finding
only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must
have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of
course, she did. This is the day of the reaping.

I prop myself up on one elbow. There’s enough light in
the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up
on her side, cocooned in my mother’s body, their cheeks
pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger,
still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim’s face is as fresh
as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she
was named. My mother was very beautiful once, too. Or
so they tell me.
