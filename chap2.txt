One time, when I was in a blind in a tree, waiting
motionless for game to wander by, I dozed off and fell
ten feet to the ground, landing on my back. It was as if
the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs,
and I lay there struggling to inhale, to exhale, to do
anything.

Thatâ€™s how I feel now, trying to remember how to
breathe, unable to speak, totally stunned as the name
bounces around the inside of my skull. Someone is
gripping my arm, a boy from the Seam, and I think
maybe I started to fall and he caught me.
