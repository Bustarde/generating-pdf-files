The moment the anthem ends, we are taken into

custody. I don’t mean we’re handcuffed or anything, but
a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the front
door of the Justice Building. Maybe tributes have tried to
escape in the past. I’ve never seen that happen though.
Once inside, I’m conducted to a room and left alone. It’s
the richest place I’ve ever been in, with thick, deep
carpets and a velvet couch and chairs. I know velvet
because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the
stuff. When I sit on the couch, I can’t help running my
fingers over the fabric repeatedly. It helps to calm me as
I try to prepare for the next hour. The time allotted for
the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones. I cannot
afford to get upset, to leave this room with puffy eyes
and a red nose. Crying is not an option. There will be
more cameras at the train station.
